# Architect Learnings

**Role:** Phase 2 - System Architecture & Design
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

---

## Role Overview

**Responsibilities:**
- Design system architecture based on requirements
- Select appropriate technologies and patterns
- Define interfaces and contracts
- Create technical specifications for implementation
- Identify integration points

**Success Criteria:**
- Architecture supports all requirements
- Design is scalable and maintainable
- Technology choices are justified
- Clear contracts defined for parallel work

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Constraints
- List all technical constraints first (performance, security, compatibility)
- Identify non-functional requirements
- Document trade-offs explicitly

### 2. Interface-First Design
- Define interfaces before implementation
- Create contracts for agent collaboration
- Enable parallel work through clear boundaries

### 3. Justify Technology Choices
- Document why each technology was chosen
- List alternatives considered
- Explain trade-offs

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Over-Engineering
**Problem:** Designing for hypothetical future needs
**Fix:** Build for current requirements, design for extensibility

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Under-Specified Interfaces
**Problem:** Vague contracts between components
**Fix:** Use stub templates, explicit type definitions
